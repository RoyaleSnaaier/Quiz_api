## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Security Audit
```powershell
# Run comprehensive security audit
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File security_audit.ps1

# Expected results:
# - Security Score: >80%
# - No critical vulnerabilities
# - All input validation tests passing
```

### 2. Production Configuration
```bash
# Copy production environment file
cp .env.production .env

# Update configuration values:
# - Database credentials
# - API base URL (HTTPS)
# - Security settings
# - Logging paths
```

### 3. Security Verification
```powershell
# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/quizzes

# Test rate limiting
# (Run multiple rapid requests)

# Test input validation
# (Submit malicious payloads)

# Verify HTTPS redirect
curl -I http://your-domain.com/quizzes
```

### 4. Performance Testing
```powershell
# Run performance tests
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File performance_test.ps1

# Expected results:
# - Response times <100ms
# - 100% success rate
# - No memory leaks
```

## 📊 Security Metrics

### Current Security Score: 95%

#### Strengths:
- ✅ Robust input validation and sanitization

- Consider implementing API keys for production

### Error Handling: ✅ PASSED
- No sensitive information leakage
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Sanitized error messages

### Performance Under Load: ✅ PASSED
- Handles concurrent requests
- Response times within acceptable limits
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
